right upper lobe opacity where the medial upper right scapula and the posterior right fourth rib overlap , could be artifactual , however , not well seen on the prior study . recommend further evaluation with ap lordotic views and / or oblique views to assess for underlying pulmonary nodule . if finding persists on the followup radiographs , chest ct would be indicated .
no significant interval change . streaky retrocardiac opacities may be due to atelectasis .
no evidence of pneumonia . prominence of the lower right mediastinal contour , for which non-emergent chest ct is recommended to distinguish a tortuous or dilated ascending aorta from a low lying anterior mediastinal mass such as a thymoma .
no radiographic evidence of active pulmonary tuberculosis .
no acute intrathoracic process .
opacification of the left lower lobe , could reflect pneumonia and is unchanged from prior examination . these findings were discussed with dr. ___ by dr. ___ ___ telephone on ___ at 2:10 pm , time of discovery .
no acute cardiopulmonary process .
right upper lobe pneumonia . recommend followup to resolution .
no fracture identified . however , if there is continued clinical concern , dedicated rib films can be obtained .
no acute cardiopulmonary process .
new tiny left apical pneumothorax . unchanged small residual left pleural effusion and left basilar opacity . unchanged tiny right pleural effusion .
no acute cardiopulmonary process .
no evidence of acute intrathoracic abnormality .
interval resolution of left basilar airspace opacity , which may have been due to atelectasis .
no acute cardiopulmonary process . right lower lobe atelectasis . no pneumoperitoneum .
no acute cardiopulmonary process .
bibasilar opacities , most suggestive of atelectasis . no focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia .
cardiomegaly , no acute findings .
no acute cardiopulmonary process . no evidence of free air beneath the diaphragm .
ng tube in mid stomach , unchanged from prior . left subclavian line terminates at the cavoatrial junction .
normal radiographic study of the chest .
moderate to large left and small right pleural effusions are increased from ___.
right lower lung partially calcified mass lesion does not appear to have progressed since pet - ct from ___ , based on single frontal chest x - ray . no superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process .
no acute intrathoracic process .
compared to yesterday's study , there is overall interval stability of mild acute - on - chronic congestive heart failure , right lower lobe atelectasis , and opacification of the lingula . this may represent atelectasis , or given the patient 's clinical history , consolidation from pneumonia . this is stable from yesterday 's study , but slightly increased since ___.
no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality .
no acute cardiopulmonary process .
no acute cardiopulmonary process .
increased opacification of the left lower lung may be due to developing pneumonia , in the correct clinical setting , or a larger left pleural effusion . no larger right pleural effusion .
increased right pleural effusion and mild interstitial edema . no evidence of pneumonia .
patient rotated to the right and low lung volumes make the exam slightly suboptimal . interval increase in right sided pleural effusion and atelectasis . persistent left base opacity , likely pleural effusion .
